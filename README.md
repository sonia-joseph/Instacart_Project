# Instacart_Project
Exploratory Data Analysis Project/DS course project 1

This Project was a re-do of the kaggle competition project as a part of the Triple 10 Data Science Course.
It analyzes shopper behavior for Instacart. The project is contained in a single jupiter notebook and the associated data files have been uploaded as well.
It is quite basic but was a great way to ease my way into python and data science.
